# Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)

> Absolute positioning anywhere on Earth using satellite signals — understanding both the measurement principle and the error sources that limit accuracy.

!!! info "At Bonn — MA-MORO-M02"

    Examined in **Trajectory Estimation** (`MA-MORO-M02`), 6 CP, 1st semester. The manual
    lists the whole GNSS half of this page: signals and receiver technology, observables,
    atmospheric effects and multipath, single point positioning, relative GNSS with carrier
    phases, PPP, RTK, network and kinematic GNSS, attitude determination, and GPS, GLONASS,
    Galileo and Beidou. Two written exams of 60 min, 50% each; admission to both requires
    at least 50% of the exercise points.

    *Sat this exam? [Tell us what it was actually like](https://github.com/robonn-club/guidebook/issues/new?template=exam-experience.yml) — that is the part no
    module manual can give you.*

## Topics

**GNSS Constellations and Signal Structure**
- Constellations: GPS (US), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (EU), BeiDou (China) — multi-constellation receivers use all four for better geometry and redundancy
- Signal components: carrier wave, ranging code (C/A and P-code), navigation message
- Two measurement types: code pseudorange (metre-level) and carrier phase (millimetre-level, but ambiguous)
- Frequency bands: L1, L2, L5 for GPS; multi-frequency receivers reduce ionospheric error

**Positioning Principle and Satellite Geometry**
- Pseudorange measurement — code correlation gives travel time × speed of light; "pseudo" because receiver clock is unknown; requires 4 satellites to solve for (x, y, z, clock)
- WGS84 — the reference ellipsoid used by GPS; coordinates are in ECEF; convert to geographic (lat, lon, height) or local ENU for navigation
- Dilution of Precision (DOP) — GDOP, PDOP, HDOP, VDOP; measures how satellite geometry amplifies ranging errors; PDOP < 3 is acceptable, > 6 is poor
- Least squares positioning — overdetermined system when >4 satellites; weighted by signal quality

**GNSS Error Sources**
- Ionospheric delay — signal travels slower through the ionosphere; up to 20 m error; mitigated by dual-frequency receivers or models (Klobuchar, NeQuick)
- Tropospheric delay — neutral atmosphere delay; ~2.3 m at zenith; mitigated by models (Saastamoinen, Hopfield)
- Multipath — signal reflects off buildings and terrain before reaching receiver; difficult to model; mitigated by antenna placement and signal processing
- Satellite clock and ephemeris errors — broadcast corrections in navigation message; residual errors ~1 m
- Receiver noise — thermal noise in the correlator; ~0.3 m for pseudorange, ~3 mm for carrier phase

**Differential GNSS and RTK**
- Differential GNSS (DGNSS) — a reference receiver at a known position broadcasts pseudorange corrections; removes common errors; ~0.5 m accuracy
- Single differencing — subtract observations between two receivers; cancels satellite clock errors
- Double differencing — subtract between two receivers AND two satellites; cancels both satellite and receiver clock errors; the standard RTK measurement model
- Integer ambiguity — carrier phase measurement has an unknown integer number of full cycles; must be resolved to achieve centimetre accuracy
- LAMBDA algorithm — Least-squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment; the standard method for integer ambiguity resolution; produces float solution first, then fixed
- Float solution → fixed solution — float uses real-valued ambiguities (~decimetre); fixed uses resolved integers (~centimetre); fixing requires sufficient observation time and good geometry

**Precise Point Positioning (PPP)**
- No reference station required — uses precise satellite orbit and clock products (IGS)
- Dual-frequency required — to model ionospheric delay
- Long convergence time (15–30 min) compared to RTK — ambiguity convergence is the bottleneck
- PPP-RTK — combines PPP corrections with ambiguity resolution; emerging technique

**GNSS Integrity and Augmentation**
- RAIM — Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring; detects faulty satellites using consistency checks; required for safety-critical applications
- SBAS — Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (EGNOS in Europe, WAAS in US); geostationary satellites broadcast differential corrections; ~1 m accuracy
- GNSS outages — urban canyons, tunnels, jamming; reason INS/GNSS integration (see topic 9) is mandatory for robust navigation
