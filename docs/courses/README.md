# Courses

The curriculum follows the mathematical dependencies of mobile robotics. Each topic assumes the ones listed before it. If you are already comfortable with a topic's prerequisites, you can skip it.

## The "At Bonn" boxes

Universität Bonn runs a dedicated [M.Sc. Mobile Robotics](https://www.moro.uni-bonn.de/)
(MoRo). Where a topic on this site is examined by one of that programme's six mandatory
modules, the page carries an **At Bonn** box naming the module, its credits, its semester,
and its exam format.

The mapping is close. The whole first semester is four mandatory modules —
`MA-MORO-M01` (9 CP), `MA-MORO-M02` (6 CP), `MA-MORO-M03` (6 CP) and `MA-MORO-M04` (9 CP),
exactly 30 CP — and this guidebook covers nearly all of their content. `MA-MORO-M01` on its
own spans six of the thirteen topics below.

!!! warning "Check this against the official manual before you rely on it"

    These boxes are transcribed from the official
    [module manual](https://www.moro.uni-bonn.de/medien_-moro/modulhandbuch-morob-v260227.pdf),
    version **v260227 (27 February 2026)**, and the
    [curriculum page](https://www.moro.uni-bonn.de/in-study/curriculum). Module manuals are
    revised. Never plan an exam around what you read here without confirming it against the
    current manual and the examination office.

    One known inconsistency in the source: the manual's index counts `MA-MORO-M04`
    (Computer Vision) inside the 42 CP mandatory block — and 9 + 6 + 6 + 9 + 6 + 6 = 42
    confirms it — but that module's own allocation table lists it as "Elective selection",
    because it is shared with the Computer Science M.Sc. as `MA-INF 2201`. Confirm your own
    case with the examination office.

    Nothing in these boxes describes what an exam is *like* — only what the manual states.
    That gap is deliberate, and it is
    [yours to fill](https://github.com/robonn-club/guidebook/issues/new?template=exam-experience.yml)
    if you have sat one.

The boxes cover the six mandatory modules only. Electives are out of scope, with one
exception noted on the C++ page.
