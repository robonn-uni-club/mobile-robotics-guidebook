# Localization

> Given a map, where is the robot? — estimating pose from sensor data when the environment is already known.

!!! info "At Bonn — MA-MORO-M01"

    Examined in **Introduction to Mobile Robotics** (`MA-MORO-M01`), 9 CP, 1st semester —
    the manual lists "localization" and "particle filter" among its contents. Two written exams: 120 min (67%) and 60 min (33%). You need at least 50% of the
    exercise points to be admitted to them.

    *Sat this exam? [Tell us what it was actually like](https://github.com/robonn-club/guidebook/issues/new?template=exam-experience.yml) — that is the part no
    module manual can give you.*

## Topics

**The Localization Problem**
- Position tracking vs. global localization vs. kidnapped robot — three difficulty levels
- Belief representation — why a single pose estimate is insufficient; we need a distribution

**Markov Localization**
- Discrete grid-based belief over all possible poses
- Prediction step — applying the motion model to propagate belief
- Correction step — weighting grid cells by sensor likelihood
- Computational cost — why discrete grids do not scale to 3D

**EKF Localization**
- Continuous Gaussian belief — mean pose vector and covariance matrix
- Prediction step using the odometry motion model and Jacobian
- Correction step using the landmark measurement model and Jacobian
- Data association — the hard part; matching observations to known landmarks
- Limitations — Gaussian assumption breaks down for global localization

**Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)**
- Particle set as a non-parametric belief representation
- Importance sampling — weight each particle by measurement likelihood
- Resampling — focus particles on high-probability regions
- Global localization — starting with uniform particle distribution over the entire map
- Particle degeneracy — what goes wrong without resampling; low-variance resampling as a fix
- Adaptive MCL — dynamically adjusting particle count based on filter uncertainty
